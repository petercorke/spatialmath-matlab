%TREXP Matrix exponential for so(3) and se(3)
%
% For so(3)::
%
% R = TREXP(OMEGA) is the matrix exponential (3x3) of the so(3) element OMEGA that
% yields a rotation matrix (3x3). 
%
% R = TREXP(OMEGA, THETA) as above, but so(3) motion of THETA*OMEGA.
%
% R = TREXP(S, THETA) as above, but rotation of THETA about the unit vector S.
%
% R = TREXP(W) as above, but the so(3) value is expressed as a vector W
% (1x3) where W = S * THETA. Rotation by ||W|| about the vector W.
%
% For se(3)::
%
% T = TREXP(SIGMA) is the matrix exponential (4x4) of the se(3) element SIGMA that
% yields a homogeneous transformation  matrix (4x4). 
%
% T = TREXP(SIGMA, THETA) as above, but se(3) motion of SIGMA*THETA, the
% rotation part of SIGMA (4x4) must be unit norm.
%
% T = TREXP(TW) as above, but the se(3) value is expressed as a twist vector TW
% (1x6). 
%
% T = TREXP(TW, THETA) as above, but se(3) motion of TW*THETA, the
% rotation part of TW (1x6) must be unit norm.
%
% Notes::
% - Efficient closed-form solution of the matrix exponential for arguments that are
%   so(3) or se(3).
% - If THETA is given then the first argument must be a unit vector or a
%   skew-symmetric matrix from a unit vector.
% - Angle vector argument order is different to ANGVEC2R.
